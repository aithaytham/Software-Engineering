<h1>Women won big in New York: Consider our landmark number and other election analysis</h1>
<img src='https://lehubdutemps.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mini_monkey-d-luffy-comment-etre-optimiste.jpg'><p>Crowd: A total of 50.9 percent of the votes cast in the 2020 presidential election were women. That is a drastic increase of 71 percent from the 2012 presidential election. The rise in the number of women who voted is significant, but it is not uncommon for a Republican candidate to lose in the primaries because he is not appealing to many women. It is a different matter with Democrat candidates. (Women made up more than 70 percent of the electorate in 2016, and Democrats have always had a stronghold among them.)<p>Luffy Is the Only Recount Democratic Candidate/Rhode Island: Except for the last and third votes in the primary, Ms. Is did not go to the recounts in Georgia and Hawaii. She won by 140 votes. Although Trumpâ€™s narrow margin in Georgia prevented his replacement nominee from being appointed to the Supreme Court, nearly all the votes in the state were close. Ms. Is completed the entire recount in her home state of Rhode Island. With a recount, she would have had to overcome another Republican.<p><b></b>
