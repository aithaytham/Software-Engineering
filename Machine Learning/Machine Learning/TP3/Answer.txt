1.	our data is not inoff , we can expect overfitting. The proof overfitting is happening is that the validation accuracy is over the training accuracy.
2.	Adding some epochs would not help solve the problem. To solve it, we should add some data,to find a model more simple or use regularization.

3.	We can also change the parameter optimizer and we can set it to Adam or GradientDescent instead of RMSPropOptimizer or change the loss parameter to mean_squarred_error instead of binary_entropy. But generally, binary_crossentropy is well adapted for binary classification so we would rather change the optimizer parameter.
